# Tennis Robot Project ðŸŽ¾

An autonomous tennis ball collector inspired by Tennibot.

## Project Overview
- Detects and collects tennis balls using computer vision and robotics
- Designed for use on hard and green clay courts
- Navigation avoids humans, fences, nets, and other major objects

## Folder Structure
- `vision/` - AI and image detection (OpenCV, YOLO)
- `firmware/` - Microcontroller code (Arduino, ESP32)
- `control/` - Navigation and motor control
- `app/` - Mobile or web interface (TBD)
- `docs/` - Notes, diagrams, and planning files

## Tech Stack
- C++ for firmware
- Python for computer vision
